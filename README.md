Built a modern, component-based animation showcase by migrating multiple standalone HTML/CSS/JS animation demos into a streamlined React environment. This project focuses on modularity, clean UI motion, and reusable components—creating a visually engaging playground for exploring web animations.

## 🚀 Overview

Animation Website Showcase is a React-driven platform featuring interactive animations originally created with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Each animation is reconstructed as an independent React component, improving structure, scalability, and maintainability.  
This project serves as both a learning resource and a visual portfolio of animation concepts in modern frontend development.
